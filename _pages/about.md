I was born in a remote small mountain village in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China. Graduated from [Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University](http://www.byau.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information and Computational Science in 2015; Graduated from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) with a Master's degree in Basic Mathematics in 2017. 

I used to work in [DiDi](https://www.didiglobal.com/). At present, I am working in the [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/) "China's commercial products and technology - commercial platform and architecture - commercial platform - non closed loop and brand advertising China's commercial products and technology" team as a senior engineer.

I have a variety of hobbies, such as playing badminton, listening to music, cooking, and traveling. Especially, in order to travel better, I have obtained the National Tour Guide Qualification Certificate in China.
